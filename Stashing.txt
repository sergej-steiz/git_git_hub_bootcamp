1.Initialize a new git repo in a folder
	#navigate to your home area or somewhere you like to create a new folder
	mkdir diary
	cd diary
	git status
	git init
2.Create a file called diary.txt.  Inside the file, add the following: I love my boss
	touch diary.txt
	#open file and copy paste text into

3.Add and commit the changes on the master branch
	git add diary.txt
	git commit -m "my first note in the diary"

4.Create a new branch called the-truth.  Switch to it.
	git switch -c truth

5. In the diary.txt file, erase the contents and instead replace it with:
I HATE MY BOSS
I HATE MY BOSS
I HATE MY BOSS
I HATE MY BOSS
I HATE MY BOSS

	#open the file and do the updates

6. Save the file

7. OH NO! Your boss is walking towards you! Quick, switch over to the master branch!
	git switch master
8. WHATTT? The diary.txt file still contains our confession?  Quick, stash the changes before your boss sees!!
	git stash
9. Your diary.txt file should now only contain "I love my boss"
	# yes, since swtitch to master branch will take all unstaged files with you, if no conflicts

10. As your boss walks by, add more lies to the diary.txt file:
I love my boss
I love my boss
I love my boss

11. Add and commit your changes on the master branch.
	git add diary.txt
	git commit -m "add more lies to the file"

12. Now that your boss has left, it's safe to get back to the truth! Switch over to the the-truth branch.
	git branch
	git switch truth

13. Retrieve the earlier changes that you stashed (I HATE MY BOSS x 5)
	git stash list
	git stash pop

14. Add and commit the changes on the the-truth branch
	git add diary.txt
	git commit -m "add my stash to the file with the truth about my boss"
