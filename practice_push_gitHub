to remove any folder use:
    rm -rf <folder name>
    git status    ###you will see which files in this folder were removed ###
    git add .     ### add those changes ####
    git commit -m "put your message here" #### commit changes ####
    ###now switch to the second branch <empty> ####
    git switch empty
    touch summary.txt ###create a blank txt file ###
    add .
    git commit -m "add summary file"
    git log
    git push origin master


    The -u option
        git push -u origin master
    the -u option allwos to set the upstream of the branch we're pushing. You can think of this as a link 
    connecting our local branch to a branch on GitHub. 
    Running git push - origin master sets teh upstreams of the local master branch so that it tracks the master
    branch on the origin repo.


    Option 2 : Start from Scratch
    if you haven't begun work on your local repo, you can...
        *Create a brand new repo on GitHub
        *Clone it down to your machine
        *Do some work locally
        *Push up your changes to GitHub

    make a new Repo on GitHub
        -click new ot + sign (new reposotory)
        -get name of it (public or private)
        -clone down to my mashine
        -1. copy the URL of the new repo
        -2. navigate to your distinaton with git shell
        -3. git clone <https://github.com/xxx/xxxx/demo.git>   ##put the URL of your new repo on github##
        -4. cd <folder name>    ## empty folder ##
        -git status     ##you will see it is a git repo##
        -git remote -v  ## pre configured remote called origin ##
        -touch <filename.txt>  ##create a new file, open it and put some text into##
        -git status
        -git add .
        -git commit -m "add my first 2 chickens"
        -git push origin master  ## now push your updates to github##

Rename your branch:
    -git branch ##check your branches##
    -git branch -M main  ## rename to main your current branch ##
    -git branch
