#Forking and Clone

The "fork and clone" workflow is different from anything we have seen sofar. Instead of just one centralized Github reposotory,
every developer has their own Github reposotory in addition to "main" reposotory. Developers make changes and push to their own forks
before making pull requests. It is very commonly used on large open-source projects where there may be thousands of contriburors with 
only a couple maintainers.

Forking is a GitHub feature (not Git). Forking allows us to create personal copies of other peoples' reposotories. We call those 
copies a "fork" of the original.

When we fork a repo, we're basically asking GitHub "Make me own copy of this repo please".
